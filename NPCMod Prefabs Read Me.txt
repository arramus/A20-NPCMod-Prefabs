- ABOUT NPCMOD:

The NPCMod provides players with a variety of non player characters that add immersion to 7D2D game play.
These characters range from ally (hireable assistants) to hostile (attempt to eliminate you).
These characters can spawn in each biome depending on depending on how they have been configured.
In addition, they can also be added to Prefabs/POIs and spawn, as with regular default zombie characters.
These Prefabs have been set up to spawn NPCMod entities by default.

In order to use these Prefabs for the NPCMod, the minimum requirement is to install:

Score (0-SCore)
NPCCore (0-XNPCCore)

In addition to the core files, players will typically install the NPCMod Addon Character and Feature Packs to enhance the experience.

In some cases, these packs will contain totally new characters, and be given the Prefix of 1-'Name' such as 1-RaiderzPack by Darkstardragon.
The packs can support different classes such as Bandits, Arachnids, and Enemy Animals.
If you have not installed any Addon Characters, the Prefabs will spawn 'fall back' 0-XNPCCore defaults.
If you have installed Addon Characters, such as Darkstardragon's Bandit class Raiders, expect to see them appear in the POIs.


- PREFAB INSTALLATION:

These Prefabs contain only Prefabs/POIs/Parts/Tiles associated to structures and can be installed in a variety of ways.
Here are two of the most appropriate installation methods:

1. Add the contents of the Prefab folder(s) directly to the 0-XNPCCore Prefabs folder.
The 0-XNPCCore's Prefabs folder is typically found here:
"...\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\7 Days To Die\Mods\0-XNPCCore\Prefabs"

2. Add the contents of the Prefab folder(s) directly to your 7D2D Prefabs folder.
The game's Prefabs folder is typically found here:
"...\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\7 Days To Die\Data\Prefabs"

3. A third option is to bundle them directly into an Addon Pack Mod that already contains a Prefabs folder.
An Addon Pack Mod with its own Prefabs folder will typically introduce its own custom Prefabs such as the 2-NPCXSpiderPack-ColonyExpansion.
This option is useful for creators for custom overhauls or custom POIs.

For convenience, it is easier to manage NPCMod specific Prefabs within the 0-XNPCCore\Prefabs folder.
For performance, it has been suggested that adding directly to the game's Prefabs folder increases rendering speed; especially on lower end machines.

- PREFAB CONFIGURATION FOR PREFAB CREATORS:

For the purpose of supporting NPCMod Prefabs, the 0-XNPCCore contains a variety of custom made preconfigured groups.
These were kindly created by khzmusik and conform to regular game nomenclature and format.
These groups are specifically assigned for NPCMod characters and will appear in the UI in the Editor when using 'K' on the selected Sleeper Volume.
This will allow Prefab creators to assign NPCMod types to Sleeper Volumes in their Prefabs/POIs.

Considerations:-

a) The NPCMod characters support enhanced AI and will be more aware of their surroundings.
This can cause them to roam more than regular default characters.

b) Adding a PathingCube very close to the Sleeper and typing Task=stay in its text box sets it to act like a Turret Guard. It will remain stationary.
The NPCMod characters can use all 6 Sleeper positions (not including crawler) and this can used to good effect with a delayed sighting if they are hidden.
Examples include, laying on stomach while in a bunker, laying on side while next to a defensive barrier such as a sandbag, and sitting at the top of a staircase.

c) Entities in Passive Sleeper Volumes will not appear as 'dots' on the UI for 'Clear' quests. This allows them to be used as hidden hostiles.
However, please be aware that this may frustrate players if they are hidden too well.

d) While the 0-XNPCCore supports a variety of custom Sleeper groups, it is necessary for Addon creators to assign their characters to these groups.
This is done in the entitygroups.xml with each Addon's Config folder. Entities in these groups do not need a probability added. This will set them to 1.0 (100%) by default.
If all Addon Packs follow this guidance, they will all spawn equally and fairly to ensure a wide spectrum of interactions.
If these do not exist in the specific Addon, which may best suit your Prefab, it will be necessary to contact the Addon creator or provide your own.

e) Where no 1-'Name' Addon Pack exists for a Prefab's sleeper groups, the Sleeper Volumes can fall back on default characters within the 0-XNPCCore.
The range of characters will be severely limited, but it will allow the Prefab to remain functional.
